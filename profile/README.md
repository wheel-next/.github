# wheel-next

This repo is a place to build proof of concepts for python wheels in a public open space. The intention is to only add code that will be able to be merged with upstream projects, e.g. python, warehouse, scikit-build-core. Thus licenses and contributor license agreements will be goverened by the target project.
